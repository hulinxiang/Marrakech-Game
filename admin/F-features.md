In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*

- A simple placement viewer (Task 5)
- A basic playable game (Task 7)
- A fully working game (Task 15)
- Option to play against a computer opponent (Task 16)
- Option to play against an intelligent computer opponent (Task 17)

Additional features

- Specify the names of the players and shuffle their order. 
- For a simple computer opponent, the rug string is generated by listing out all possible rug strings and randomly
  choose one.
- For an intelligent opponent, the rug string is generated by the idea to choose a rug string that has a smallest
  distances sum between it and other tiles owned by computer.
