     * Determine whether a rug String is valid.
     * For this method, you need to determine whether the rug String is valid, but do not need to determine whether it
     * can be placed on the board (you will determine that in Task 10 ). A rug is valid if and only if all the following
     * conditions apply:
     *  - The String is 7 characters long
     *  - The first character in the String corresponds to the colour character of a player present in the game
     *  - The next two characters represent a 2-digit ID number
     *  - The next 4 characters represent coordinates that are on the board
     *  - The combination of that ID number and colour is unique
     * To clarify this last point, if a rug has the same ID as a rug on the board, but a different colour to that rug,
     * then it may still be valid. Obviously multiple rugs are allowed to have the same colour as well so long as they
     * do not share an ID. So, if we already have the rug c013343 on the board, then we can have the following rugs
     *  - c023343 (Shares the colour but not the ID)
     *  - y013343 (Shares the ID but not the colour)
     * But you cannot have c014445, because this has the same colour and ID as a rug on the board already.
     * @param gameString A String representing the current state of the game as per the README
     * @param rug A String representing the rug you are checking
     * @return true if the rug is valid, and false otherwise.
